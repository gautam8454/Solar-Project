        <h2>Michigan’s Premier Solar Carport Installation Company</h2>
        <p>
          Solar carports are overhead canopies built to cover parking areas—and are distinct from solar panels installed
          onto pre-existing carport structures. Solar carports have many things in common with ground mount solar arrays
          (which are angled panel modules installed on the ground rather than a rooftop).
        </p>

        <p>
          Both ground mount solar and solar carports eliminate the need for a surface on which the panels could be mounted. The primary difference between a solar carport and a typical ground mount installation is that carports are taller to make space for a car to park. Otherwise, the two are quite similar and each offer the benefit of allowing installers to orient the panels at the most optimal angle for sunlight exposure.
        </p>

        <p>
         The great advantage of solar carports is that they don’t require additional land the way a ground mount does. As a result, solar panel carports offer a more efficient use of space than ground mounted panels. If you are concerned about efficient use of space, you may wish to consider a solar carport over a ground mounted system. Overall, solar panel carports have less restraints or conflicts than ground mounted solar, and may be considered preferable under many circumstances.
