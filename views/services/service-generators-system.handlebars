        <h2> Generator Service at Your Home in 24 Hours or Less</h2>
        <p>
          With an office and technicians strategically located in Brighton, Michigan, we’re typically able to reach your
          Michigan site within two hours (and often in an hour or less). Each technician’s service truck is fully
          stocked with parts, GPS, a laptop, and all the equipment necessary to perform testing, maintenance, repair,
          and other services such as fuel tank integrity analysis, and diesel fuel filtration and reconditioning. We
          also offer a unique remote monitoring system designed to allow off-site diagnosis and, in some cases,
          resolution of an issue by means of direct serial connection, phone line, or Ethernet connection.

        <h2> Experience When it Counts</h2>
        <p>
          Our factory-trained, certified technicians perform filter changes and other routine maintenance—as well as
          thorough, periodic inspections of your equipment, including all electrical components and wiring. By detecting
          and repairing issues, often before they become a problem, we are able to reduce the need for emergency
          repairs. Give us a call to make sure you’re prepared when the next power outage occurs.

        <h2> Generator Maintenance Program</h2>
        <p>
          Like all mechanical equipment, your generator requires care and maintenance to keep it operating properly. The
          Green Panel offers a program of scheduled maintenance for generators of any brand or size, anywhere in
          Michigan’s upper or lower peninsulas.
