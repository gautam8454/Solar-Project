        <h2>The Future Is Now!</h2>
        <p>
          Solar Company battery system is the ideal solution for solar systems, which are dedicated to using solar
          energy for optimal performance. The home battery system prioritises solar energy first and ensures the
          compliment of power by drawing energy from the batteries and the public grid during consumption peaks.</p>
        <p>
          Solar energy has become the most dominant renewable energy for residential and commercial installations, and
          with its huge range of energy saving, cost saving and environmental benefits, it’s not hard to see why.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, as london's retail energy grid prices continue to rise, maybe it’s time we start looking to get as energy
          independent as possible. To do so, you will need a solar-plus-battery storage system! Like solar panels in
          recent times, batteries have become increasingly more affordable for home and business owners to both get off
          the grid, gain energy independence and benefit from instant and long-standing energy cost savings.

        <h2>Get the Most From Your Solar <br> Panels with Lithium Ion Batteries</h2>
        <p>Solar Company provides expert installation of backup battery power solutions that are sufficient for handling
          most residential needs, (including refrigerators, computers, televisions, alarm systems, and electrical
          outlets). Advanced systems are even capable of handling heavier loads, such as heating and cooling systems,
          washers and dryers, and more.</p>
        <p>
          With our turnkey renewable energy services, we can design a system from scratch that includes the solar panel
          procurement and installation. For those who already have solar panels and wish to upgrade their system with a
          lithium-ion battery backup system for their existing solar panels, we will take into account your lifestyle,
          budget, and existing system to choose the perfect battery storage unit for your needs.</p>
